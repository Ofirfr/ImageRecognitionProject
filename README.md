# Horse - Donkey - Zebra Classifier
###### This project is a image classifier that predicts whether an image is a zebra, a horse or a donkey.
###### I am using PyTorch for training the model, and Flask for the simple site that interacts with the model.
###### You can see an example of the model in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIFXHB46e_1rfmtc-Gd5iwcZtNdPwzWb/view).
